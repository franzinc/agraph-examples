 {{ .Chart.Name }} -  Helm chart for running an AllegroGraph cluster with Multi-Master Replication

The full details on this chart can be found at

  https://github.com/franzinc/agraph-examples/blob/master/clustering/kubernetes/mmr/kubernetes-mmr.md

That contains a description of how the chart works as well as how to modify what it does.



Once the chart is installed you can access the controlling instance via a load balancer

Run

% kubectl get svc

To find the address of the controlling-loadbalancer.

It will take a few minutes for the external IP address to be allocated and
show by this kubectl command.

For example:

NAME                            TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)           AGE
sample-controlling-loadbalancer LoadBalancer   10.12.8.217   104.155.148.58   10035:32240/TCP   113s

Given the above you can access the controlling instance through the load balancer
at:

http://104.155.148.58:10035

The default username is "test" and the default password is "xyzzy"

You can do read and write access of the MMR cluster through the controlling-loadbalancer.

There is also a copy-loadbalancer.  This distributes work to all the copy nodes.
The load balancer does not yet have session support so you should only
use the copy-loadbalancer for queries to the repository.

We also have a created a copy-0-loadbalancer as a demonstration of how to
communicate with a single specified copy instance.  Since this load
balancer is always talking to the same instance one can do read and write accesses through
this load balancer.   However the copy instances can be deleted by
kubernetes if you reduce the number of replicas defined.

One way to change the number of replicas is to edit values.yaml
and specify the desired number of replicas and then

% helm upgrade releasename chart

where releasename and chart are the same as
in the command you used to install the chart

% helm install releasename chart
