# This will create a service with an external IP address through which
# one can access the the copy-0  instance.
# Since there's just one copy-0 instance we don't need to worry
# about the fact that the load balancer has no support for sessions.
#
# The external IP will be chosen by the cloud provider
#
# This is just an example of how one specifies a particular instance
# of a StatefulSet.   We won't normally use this load balancer
