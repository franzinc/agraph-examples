# This will create a service with an external IP address
# through which one can access a randomly chosen copy instance.
# There is no support for sessions so don't create an agraph session
# using the external IP address.  This is mainly useful for
# simple non-session transactions or for queries to one of the
# copies of the repo
#
# The external IP will be chosen by the cloud provider
